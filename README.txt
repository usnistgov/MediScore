from a command line.  These scripts have been tested under the
following versions of Ubuntu Linux and OS X.

  Mac OS X 10.12.3
  Ubuntu Linux 14.04.4


INSTALLATION
------------

(Lines starting with $ are command lines)

1) Install Python 2.7 (tested in Python == 2.7.13).

2) Required packages:
  Prior to running the Scorer, the following packages need to be installed :
  - opencv        (tested in versions 2.4.13 and 3.4.0)
  - numpy         (tested in versions 1.14.0)
  - pandas        (tested in version 0.21.1) - make sure to use the latest version.

  Most of these packages can be installed by running basic_install.sh on your machine.

  Optional :
  - pydot (tested in version 1.2.3) -- For graphical output from
    ProvenanceGraphBuildingScorer.py

  ImageMagick is not required, but is highly recommended to accelerate
  the validator.  Download instructions may be found in the following
  link: http://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

* Installation example for Linux:
  - Install Anaconda for Python 2.7 version: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
    1) https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    2) $ bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
  - Install opencv using conda:
    $ conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv
  - Check the required packages using "conda list"
  - Install missing packages using "conda install"

* SSH with XQuartz on OS X for saving or displaying plots:
  - If you want to run the code using ssh on OSX, you may install XQuartz from the website:
    https://www.xquartz.org/, then
    $ ssh -X servername

3) To test your installation, run MediScore's "make check" in the MediScore directory.
   You should expect to see ERROR messages pop up as we test the behavior of the functions.
   If you see the following messages, your make check completed successfully.
   - ALL DSD VALIDATION TESTS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED
   - ALL SSD VALIDATION TESTS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED
   - MASK SCORER TESTS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED
   - DETECTION SCORER TESTS SUCCESSFULLY PASSED


USAGE
-----

Usage text for each script can be seen by executing the script with
the option '--help'.  For example:

  $ cd MediScore/tools/DetectionScorer
  $ python DetectionScorer.py --help

Both DetectionScorer and MaskScorer scripts have additional
HTML files (DetectionScorerReadMe.html and MaskScorerReadMe.html) with more detailed information on their usage.

To try some command lines with data files, go to the testing
directories in 'MediScore/tools/DetectionScorer', and run the command
lines below.
  $ python DetectionScorer.py -t manipulation --refDir ../../data/test_suite/detectionScorerTests/sample \
  -r NC2016-manipulation-ref.csv -x NC2016-manipulation-index.csv --sysDir ../../data/test_suite/detectionScorerTests/sample \
  -s D_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-me_1/D_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-me_1.csv --outRoot ./testcases/NC16_01 --display

To validate the system output, cd to the tools directory and execute the
following script with the index file after the -x option, your system output
after the -s option, and the validation task after the -vt option. For example:

   $ python2 validator.py -x ../data/test_suite/validatorTests/NC2016_Test0516_dfz/indexes/NC2016-manipulation-index.csv \
     -s ../../data/test_suite/validatorTests/foo_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-whole_1/foo_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-whole_1.csv \
     -vt SSD
   $ python2 validator.py -x ../data/test_suite/validatorTests/NC2016_Test0516_dfz/indexes/NC2016-splice-index.csv \
     -s ../../data/test_suite/validatorTests/lorem_NC2016_Splice_ImgOnly_p-whole_1/lorem_NC2016_Splice_ImgOnly_p-whole_1.csv \
     -vt DSD

You may also control printout with the -v option. Add -v 1 for more detailed print output and -v 0 to suppress all printout. For example:

   $ python2 validator.py -x ../data/test_suite/validatorTests/NC2016_Test0516_dfz/indexes/NC2016-manipulation-index.csv \
     -s ../../data/test_suite/validatorTests/foo_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-whole_1/foo_NC2016_Manipulation_ImgOnly_p-whole_1.csv \
     -vt SSD \
     -v 1

will generate more detailed information for the SSD Validator than if -v is not selected.

TEST CASE BUG REPORT (TODO)
--------------------

If the error occurred wile doing a 'make check', go in the directory
associated with the tool that failed (for example:
'tools/DetectionScorer'), and type 'make makecompcheckfiles'. This
process will create a file corresponding to each test number named
"res_test*.txt-comp". These file are (like their .txt equivalent) text
files that can be compared to the original "res_test*.txt" files in the
data/test_suite directory.

 When a test fails, please send us the "res_test*.txt-comp" file of the
failed test(s) for us to try to understand what happened, as well as
information about your system (OS, architecture, ...) that you think
might help us.  Thank you for helping us improve MEDIFOR system.
